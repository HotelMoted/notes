Okay, let's address the Network Engineer's concern about upstream redundancy regarding the proposed host-based VXLAN BGP EVPN solution (Software VTEPs on Proxmox hosts, managed via Proxmox SDN).

It seems there might be a misunderstanding of how gateway redundancy is achieved within a modern VXLAN EVPN fabric, compared to traditional L2 networks. The statement that it "won't help with upstream redundancy unless you want to have multiple copies of the vms with different IP configurations" is **not accurate** for a properly implemented EVPN overlay.

Here's how the host-based VXLAN EVPN solution *does* provide upstream (specifically, first-hop gateway) redundancy without needing multiple VMs or IPs:

1.  **Anycast Distributed Gateway:**
    * In a VXLAN EVPN environment configured for Layer 3 routing (using L3 VNIs and Integrated Routing and Bridging - IRB), the default gateway for VMs within a specific VNI (virtual network segment) is typically configured as an **Anycast Gateway**.
    * This means the **exact same gateway IP address** and the **exact same virtual MAC address** are configured on the corresponding virtual routing interface (like an SVI or IRB interface) **on every single Proxmox host (VTEP)** participating in that L3 VNI.
    * Proxmox SDN facilitates this when you define a gateway IP for a subnet within an EVPN-enabled VNet. FRR, managed by Proxmox SDN, implements this distributed gateway functionality.

2.  **VM's Perspective:**
    * The VM (e.g., `192.168.10.5`) is configured to use the *single* Anycast Gateway IP (e.g., `192.168.10.1`) as its default gateway.
    * When the VM needs to send traffic off-subnet, it performs a standard ARP request for its gateway (`192.168.10.1`).

3.  **Local ARP Resolution:**
    * Because the Anycast Gateway IP and MAC exist *locally* on the Proxmox host the VM is currently running on, that **local host immediately responds** to the ARP request with the shared virtual MAC address. The ARP request doesn't even need to traverse the physical network or VXLAN fabric.

4.  **Egress Routing:**
    * The VM sends its outbound packet to the Anycast Gateway's virtual MAC address.
    * The local Proxmox host's network stack receives this packet. Since the destination gateway IP is configured locally on its IRB interface, the host performs the Layer 3 lookup and routes the packet.
    * The host then encapsulates the packet in VXLAN, using its own VTEP IP as the source and the appropriate destination VTEP IP (either another host for East-West traffic or a Border Leaf for North-South traffic) as the destination.

5.  **Inherent Redundancy:**
    * The first-hop gateway function is **distributed across all hosts**. If one host fails, the VM simply gets restarted (via Proxmox HA) or was already running on another host. The Anycast Gateway function is immediately available on the new host the VM runs on.
    * There is no reliance on a single physical router pair running VRRP/HSRP for the first-hop gateway function *within the overlay*. The redundancy is built into the distributed nature of the Anycast Gateway across all VTEPs.

6.  **Physical Path Redundancy:**
    * The redundancy of the *physical paths* the encapsulated VXLAN traffic takes depends on the **L3 underlay network design**. If your physical network provides multiple equal-cost paths (ECMP) between hypervisor nodes and towards border gateways, the underlay routing protocols (OSPF, BGP) will automatically load-balance the *tunneled* traffic across these paths. VXLAN leverages the underlay's redundancy.

**Addressing the Engineer's Points Directly:**

* **"Won't help with upstream redundancy"**: This is incorrect regarding the logical first-hop gateway. The Anycast Gateway feature inherent in EVPN provides robust distributed gateway redundancy *within the overlay*. Physical path and border gateway redundancy depend on the underlay and egress design, respectively, which are separate considerations applicable to both hardware and software VTEP models.
* **"Unless... multiple copies of the VMs with different IP configurations"**: This workaround is unnecessary. The Anycast Gateway allows a single VM with a single IP configuration to have a highly available first-hop exit point regardless of which host it runs on.

**Conclusion:**

The host-based VXLAN BGP EVPN solution, when configured correctly with an Anycast Distributed Gateway (which is standard practice and supported by Proxmox SDN's integration with FRR), **does provide significant upstream redundancy** for the critical first-hop gateway function. It achieves this in a distributed manner across all participating hypervisor nodes, transparently to the VM and without requiring multiple VM instances or IP addresses. Further redundancy for physical paths or N-S border egress depends on the design of the underlying physical network and fabric exit points.
